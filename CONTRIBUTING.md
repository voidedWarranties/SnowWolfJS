## Contributing to SnowWolf
Contributions must be made using the Atom text editor (https://atom.io). Default spacing should be used.
Linux (Ubuntu Budgie is what I use) makes it **much** easier to contribute. Please consider using Linux, or using a VM.
A Debian based distribution is recommended.

Look at existing files in the repository to see how to add files. Your modules/features should be config-friendly (tweakable).

Also keep in mind that the code you add will be for everybody to see. Keep all private information **private**.

Once your feature is done, feel free to make a Pull Request. Please title it appropriately.
If you are trusted, you may become able to directly push to the repository, as a contributor.

> **Please push using Git CLI.**

Thanks for your contributions!
